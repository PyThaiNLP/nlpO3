## Build It Yourself

### Build requirements

- [Rust 2018 Edition](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Python 3.6 or newer
- Python Development Headers
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev`
  - macOS: No action needed
- [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) - already included in Cargo.toml
- [setuptools-rust](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust)

### Build steps

(to be revise for setuptools-rust toolchain)

#### Linux
```bash
maturin build --release -i python --manylinux off
```
or
```bash
maturin build --release -i python
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```shell
path\\to\\maturin.exe build --release -i python
```

#### macOS
```zsh
maturin build --release -i python3
```

This should generate a wheel file, in `target/wheels/` directory, which can be installed by pip.

Note: Omitting "-i python" will let Maturin build for all Python versions detected.
